# CISSheetShinyApp
An app written in R that pulls data from specific MasterLists of curriculum data, and generates all the required CIS sheets for those courses.

All files should be included in a single folder, along with the desired master list. The master list file must retain its generated fie name that follows the template "Course Master List - 20XX-20XX.xlsm"
